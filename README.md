# FaceRecognition App


## How To Use 







## Development

This application was developed using React.js for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. This project has a back-end which takes care of registering users in the PostgreSQL database, and keeping track of how many times each user has submitted a picture. 

When the image URL is submitted, the app uses the Clarifai API to recognize the face and return the coordinates where its located.
