If this is your first time, you will need to register

  <br>
</h2>

Once you register, you wil need to give the App a Google Image Adress so it will recognize the face
<h2 align="center">

  <br>
</h2>

Copy the URL and paste it on the searchfield and click the detect button. Once you do, the App will show you the image with the face inside a blue blox. The app will also keep track of how many times you have submitted an image

And that's it! Once you log out your user and entry count will be kept safe in the database.
